        This visualisation offers a novel and fun way to view the movement of players across different teams in the NBA. For a given season and
        team, you can see a map showing the trajectories of all players on that team from their initial NBA team leading up to that season.

        Additionally, you can also select a player either using the drop down box on the right, or by clicking on one of the trajectories. This
        will highlight the players team history and play an animation to simulate their trajectory through the NBA. Additionally you can see a
        card showing the player's pre-NBA affiliation (be it college or other professional league), and their country of origin.
