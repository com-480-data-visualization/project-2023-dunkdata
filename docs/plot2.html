        This visualization shows both head-to-head and home vs away performance for a given team since the 2016-17 season. After selecting a
        team from the carousel, you can select a metric from the drop down box to the your selectd team's performance at each away
        location throughout the NBA.
      </p>
      <p>
        The circles are colored on a scale according to the team's relative performance at different
        locations, with a teams best performance in the given metric being shaded green and their worst performing venue being
        shaded red. The size of the circles also indicates the team's win percentage at the given away location. Thus you can see at a glance
        which away venues the team is more successful at, and whether or not the given metric is correlated with this.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you hover on a circle in the map you can get a more detailed view of the team's performance at that location, including
        their record in the last 5 games, and the actual values of the selected metric and win percentage at this location.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, clicking
        on a circle brings up some plots to show the head-to-head performance of the two selected teams, both in home and away games. The
        team which performs better in each metric at a given venue is highlighted in yellow, allowing you to gauge at a glance if there are any
        trends in how teams perform in a specific head-to-head matchup, both at home and away.
